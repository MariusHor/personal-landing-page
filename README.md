# Marius Horghidan Personal Portfolio

### 👋 Hello there 

This was my first attempt at building a personal portfolio website. I made the mistake to jump into building a rather big project without having enough knowledge of Javascript and I clearly over complicated things while not really understanding what I was doing :) I will keep this repository as a reminder to the progress that I will be making in the future :)
